                    After dropping out of ITE once, i enrolled for a second time after my National Service. I took me 2
                    years to
                    figure what my passion and interest was. I decided that Information Technology was the right path
                    for me
                    and
                    during my 2 years of study in Nitec, I worked hard to make sure i didn't have to go through another
                    2
                    years
                    in Higher Nitec. My goal was to get a direct entry into a polytechnic so i could save some time
                    given my
                    age.<br><br>My hard work paid off when i graduated with a perfect GPA and got into Singapore
                    Polytechnic
                    shortly after!<br><br>I'll be sharing some of my favourite adventures in ITE below!</label>

                            for 2 weeks to work on a networking project with the students of Tech College. Of course it
                            wasn't all work, we had tons fun and time to explore the cities and even had a day trip to
